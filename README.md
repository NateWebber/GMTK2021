# Matrimonium
In Matrimonium, you are the manager of a busy "15 minute marriage" business in Las Vegas! As your patrons mill about the waiting room, it's up to you to help them find their spouses-to-be and join them together in holy matrimony. But be sure to work fast, you aren't getting paid by the hour!



This game is a submission for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam. The theme is "joined together", which I took in a more literal sense, as the main gameplay loop involves marrying people.



I didn't end up spending as much of my 48 hours on this as I thought I would, but for my first real game jam I am fairly proud of the final product, and I may even continue development in the future.
